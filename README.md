Err‚Ä¶ hi, I guess.

I write code for the web for a living. Sometimes I write other code for open source projects ‚Äî many of which are ridiculous. Occasionally I get accused of being a Software Engineer.

I used to be fairly active in the open source community, but not so much any more. Life thrust other priorities upon me.

Here‚Äôs a collection of links to things for more context:

- üíª [My open source projects](https://gilmoreorless.github.io/), in a more prioritised form than the default GitHub UI below.
- ‚úçÔ∏è [My website and blog](https://shoehornwithteeth.com/). Some posts that are particularly relevant for this open source work:
  - [LOSS: Lazy Open-Source Software](https://shoehornwithteeth.com/ramblings/2015/10/loss-lazy-open-source-software/).
  - [My future in tech](https://shoehornwithteeth.com/ramblings/2018/08/my-future-in-tech/).
- üìì [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@gilmoreorless) for some interactive experiments.

I don‚Äôt list my employer here for two reasons. First, I‚Äôd likely forget to update it for years. But most importantly, the company that happens to currently pay my salary is not in control of the other aspects of my life, including any coding projects I choose to spend some free time on.

I‚Äôm also [not on social media any more](https://shoehornwithteeth.com/ramblings/2023/02/mastodontcare/).
